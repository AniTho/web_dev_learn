            <section>
                <p>As a machine learning engineer, I was thrilled to see your company posting for the position of deep
                    learning engineer, on your website. After reviewing all the requirements, I found myself fulfilling
                    most
                    of the requirements, if not all. I have a good amount of exposure in the domain and am almost
                    spending
                    my academic career to work in this particular domain. Despite my limited eposure to the industry, I
                    have
                    tried to bridge the gap between the academia and industry by practically applying everything that I
                    have
                    studied theoretically, either by building the projects - while studying a particular topic or
                    subject -
                    or by working on freelance projects.</p>

                <h2>Education: </h2>
                <p>I have completed my <em>Bachelor of Technology (<abbr>B.Tech.</abbr>) </em> in Computer Science and
                    Engineering (<abbr>CSE</abbr>) from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (<abbr>SMVDU</abbr>), J&K,
                    with a CGPA of <strong>9.19</strong>. Currently I am pursuing my <abbr>MS</abbr> By Research in Data
                    Science from Indian Institute of Technology (<abbr>IIT</abbr>), Bombay.

                <h2>Research Area: </h2>
                <p>My area of research lies in the domain of computer vision and have worked on different projects
                    covering range of topics in computer vision, namely:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently, I am working on scene graph generation as my research topic which involves
                        generating a graph scene out of an image by leveraging object detection/scene segmentation.</li>
                    <li>I have also worked on various classification architecture from Convolutional Neural Network
                        based architecture to the current state of the art Visual Transformer architecture</li>
                    <li>I have also worked with generative adversarial networks (<abbr> GAN </abbr>)for various tasks,
                        such as image colorization using pix 2 pix architecture. For my course project, I tried to build
                        one using transformers</li>
                    <li>I also have some expertise in web development and for deploying of model by building an endpoint
                        api for the trained model.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>I would like to thank you for considering my application for the role and hope that you would find my
                    expertise beneficial for the company, to consider me for hiring for the role. Looking forward to
                    hear back from you.</p>
