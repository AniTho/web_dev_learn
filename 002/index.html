    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Aniket Thomas and I was born in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh - I hope you don't have any preconceived
        bias for Ghaziabad. Currently, I am pursuing my masters in data science. Before, I used to be a very nerdy guy
        who used to mostly study (apparently I was not a prodigy so I have to replace it with hard work), but now I am
        focusing on my all round development and I also know that probably I am too old for that but well like a famous
        saying goes - <em> you're never too old to learn. </em> Nice to have you visit my portfolio, hopefully I can
        pique your interest or probably help you find what you're looking for. And yes, this is how I look like
        currently.
    </p>
